*
* The biologists group at the Bioinformatics Institute got a turtle.

After training the turtle learned to understand and remember instructions, which look like the following:
North 10
West 20
South 30
East 40
where the first word is a direction, in which the turtle should move, and the number after the word ‚Äî the positive
*  distance in centimeters, which the turtle should pass.
Nevertheless, issuing commands is fast, but the turtle moves slowly.
* That is why programmers figured out that they could write a program
* that determines to where eventually the biologists will lead the turtle.
*  To do this, programmers ask you to write a program that outputs the point at which
* the turtle will arrive after performing all of the issued commands.
* For simplicity, they have decided to assume that the movement starts at the point (0, 0),
* and the movement to the east increases the first coordinate, to the north ‚Äì the second one.

The program gets a number of commands ùëõ as input, which should be performed by the turtle,
*  followed by the ùëõ lines with the commands themselves. You need to output two numbers in the single line:
*  the first and the second coordinate of the final point for the turtle. All coordinates are integers.
